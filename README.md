# LatexDraw
A small tool I made to stitch together images and compile them into a pdf. I use it to make a pdf from my handwritten assignments.


## How to use it
 - Browse for the folder with the png-files to be compiled
 - Enter a filename
 - Enter a title for the document
 
 LatexDraw will create a Latex-document with all .png-files in the folder, compile it using pdflatex, and then open the pdf.
